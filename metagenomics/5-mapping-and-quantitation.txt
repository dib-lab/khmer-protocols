5. Mapping and abundance quantitation
=====================================

.. note::

   You can start from this point by taking the following files from
   the data on snapshot snap-8f89b092::

      SRR606249.pe.qc.fq.gz
      final-assembly.fa

.. shell start


   Just do::

      cd /mnt/work/
      cp final-assembly.fa metagenome.fa 


Let's do some simple mapping to do abundance estimation in final assembly.


Bowtie mapping
==============

Let's start by installing `bowtie <http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml>`__::

   cd /root
   curl -O -L http://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie/0.12.7/bowtie-0.12.7-linux-x86_64.zip
   unzip bowtie-0.12.7-linux-x86_64.zip
   cd bowtie-0.12.7
   cp bowtie bowtie-build bowtie-inspect /usr/local/bin

Next, build a bowtie reference from the assembly::

   cd /mnt/work/
   bowtie-build metagenome.fa metagenome

and then do the mapping::

   gunzip -c SRR606249.pe.qc.fq.gz | bowtie -p 4 -q metagenome - > SRR606249.map

At the moment, there seems to be no good way to do automated differential
analysis of two samples, so we'll just show you how to annotate the
assembled sequences with the mapping abundance.  This will allow MG-RAST
to properly weight annotation calls.

To do this, we will need to make two copies of the annotated assembly
 with the first (SRR606249) abundances. ::


   python /usr/local/share/khmer/sandbox/make-coverage.py metagenome.fa SRR606249.map
   mv metagenome.fa.cov metagenome.SRR606249.fa


What you will see now is that there's a [cov] annotation for each
sequence in every file -- try::

   head -4 metagenome.SRR606249.fa

and you should see::

   >testasm.1[cov=259]
   CAATTTATTTAAATTTTTCTACGATTCCAACA...
   >testasm.2[cov=610]
   ATTCTACTAATGTCATCTTTTTACCTTCTAGA...

This format can be uploaded directly to MG-RAST as an
abundance-annotated assembly, although there's no good way to do
comparative analysis yet.
